title: Sidebar Navigation
---
By default, CelestialDocs sites include sidebar navigation. It is generated after parsing the folder structure of `docs` folder.

## Custom order

By default, it will order the top-level items (folders and files that are immediately inside the `docs` folder) alphabetically. But we can provide a custom order to the top level items. 

In `config.js` you can set `side_nav_menu_order` with an order of items. Mind that the type is an array of strings. Each string is just the `slug` of that page.

```js
// config.js

export const side_nav_menu_order: string[] = ["getting-started", "guides"];
// getting-started.mdx (file)
// guides (folder)
```

You can include `folder-name`, `md` & `mdx` files. If you don't order every items, then the left out folders and files will the ordered after that. Don't add extensions for `md` & `mdx` files.

## Hide Sidebar Navigation

### Hide globally

In `config.js`, you can hide sidebar navigation by keeping the value of `hide_side_navigations` as `true`. This will hide the sidebar navigation for all pages. 

```js
// config.js

export const docconfig = {
  ...
  hide_side_navigations: true,
  ...
};
```

### Hide locally

To hide sidebar navigation for specific pages only, then add `hide_sidenav` in the frontmatter as `true`.

```yaml
---
hide_sidenav: true
---
```
